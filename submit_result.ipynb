    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following installed and configured:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ollama**: Local AI model server (Script will do)\n",
    "   - Install Ollama from [https://ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)\n",
    "   - Pull the gpt-oss:20b model: `ollama pull gpt-oss:20b`\n",
    "   - Ensure Ollama is running on `localhost:11434`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **OpenAI Python Library**: For API communication\n",
    "   - Install via pip: `pip install openai`\n",
    "   - Used to communicate with the Ollama server through OpenAI-compatible API\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Requirements**:\n",
    "   - Target Model: `gpt-oss:20b`\n",
    "   - Endpoint: `http://localhost:11434/v1`\n",
    "   - API Key: `ollama` (default for local Ollama)\n"
